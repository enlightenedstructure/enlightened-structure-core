              ## Superseding the Scarcity Economy

              The Trust Exchange utilizes the network of trust relationships that already exist, making them visible, interlinked and actionable.  Most of our decisions are based on collective opinions and discernment, particularly those of friends we trust.  The Trust Exchange brings visibility to your friends' ratings of products, companies, websites, and more.  In turn, you can rate your trust level of a friend or information source in any category, where categories are simply user-created tags.  One friend you may trust for their computer knowledge and another for their culinary capacity.

              ## Interoperability

              The Trust Exchange amalgamates existing ratings from any source, feeding them into an open platform.  Instead of owning your ratings and trust information, like existing online networks and organizations, the Trust Exchange is a simple and powerful open platform for humanity to exchange its trust information.  Individuals can choose whether to make ratings publicly available, or share them privately with trusted friends.

              ## Transparency 

              The purpose of the Trust Exchange is to support and facilitate the era of transparency that is emerging.  Anyone doing research on a purchase can tap into the publicly available ratings of relevant companies to help them choose a product or supplier aligned with their own values.  Corporations, too, can become model citizens when social capital is tied closely enough to revenue.  The engine of capitalism then becomes an engine for systemic self-improvement.

              ## Solutions to our Biggest Issues

              Corporations tend to pursue profit, often disregarding the good of the communities and the planet. There is a promising movement in the corporate world toward social and environmental responsibility.  This trend could be greatly accelerated by increasing transparency and allowing consumers to "vote" with their dollars. If customers were directly telling a corporation when they were (and were not) purchasing from them, then both the corporation and the shareholders would see that, even from a pure profit motive, it is in their best interest to move toward the values of the consumer.

              In the political realm, citizens suffer from a lack of transparency, getting their information from sources they don't really trust, simply because trusted information is not readily available. The Trust Exchange would make highly rated news media (text, audio, video) readily accessible by filtering it through your trust network.

              ## Who Benefits

              Unlike today's (mostly proprietary) rating systems, the public at large can benefit from the ratings exposed through the Trust Exchange. We do not propose to build another silo of proprietary information. We propose to build the network that links existing trust ratings together and inspires people to create new ratings and thereby sharing their valuable knowledge with their friends.

Users with rich online social networks would benefit even more by inheriting ratings created by their trusted contacts. Corporations and governments will have much better information about the real desires and priorities of their customers and citizens.

              -------------
              As Wikipedia has opened the encyclopedia by leveraging the wisdom of crowds, so the MPARCS project seeks to open the cutting edges of human knowledge, as represented in academic research. Research papers, or even seeds of papers, placed into the public domain with appropriate supporting technology, will allow others to build on these works, while still preserving intellectual ownership of ideas through transparency and traceability.

              A Living conversation
              ---------------------
              Academic research builds upon other research. What if this could be done incrementally, as a living conversation? What if instead of having to wait for a whole "new" idea, a paper could be improved on incrementally, by anyone who had an improvement -- minor or revolutionary? Then the world of research and noetic advancement could become truly alive, constantly morphing, reorganizing, improving the human knowledge ecosystem.

              The technology involved is an extension of the "wiki" concept popularized by Wikipedia. But instead of trying to have a single, definitive version of each article, MPARCS allows each user to copy other users' articles, for editing, combining, remixing.

              Multi-Level Content Ratings
              ---------------------------
              Ratings are an extremely important part of MPARCS. Suppose an article on a physics simulation algorithm spawns versions created by thousands of interested users. When the original author wants to review the most interesting revisions, considering whether to incorporate any of the new ideas into their own latest update, they can turn to peer ratings as a starting place, to locate the most interesting content.

              Ratings
              -------
              A sophisticated ratings system will allow ratings at several levels: from the entry level, where any person can rate any article, up to the expert level, where articles deemed particularly "interesting" by the open ratings community can be assessed by credentialed experts in a given field. Users will also be able to rate other users, so that each user can create a personalized ratings matrix, where the ratings given to articles by users they trust will be weighted more significantly than those of users unknown to them.

The system will allow users to see the complete history of any article, tracing its evolution through various authors, and providing a view of the differences between any two given versions.

              The Core Network is a social browser and visual interface based on the geometry and physics of spacetime itself.  It traces our interactions and relationships with information displayed using colors and geometric shapes, while organizing them by shared keywords, categories, and proximity references. Through this organization of personal preferences and community interactions the system enables us to more clearly see how we are related to each other, as well as how closely we are connected.

It can be used as both a standalone browser or module that can be inserted into any existing website or application. Priorities in this interface design are flexibility and ease of use. The map is rendered and displayed with physics-based movement and reorients itself according to your searches or general navigation.  The geometric structure can be rendered in 2D and 3D, and can display changes in interactions over time.
